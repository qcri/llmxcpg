Complete Process:
1. Curate dataset of code samples (vulnerable and safe) with the following properties code, cwe, and line number
2. Generate queries using LLM or manually (for now)
3. Execute the Joern queries and extract the paths (node_id and line_number)
4. Merge the extracted paths into a small and concise set of paths that comprehensivly captures the vulnerabilities within the code
5. Convert the contexts to well formatted source code
6. Evaluate and label each context individually using an LLM
